Compiling dWOL is easy.

You need a copy of FreePascal from http://www.freepascal.org/ (or if your on windows you can use Delphi 6 - it probably compiles on 7/8/turbo aswell, I dont know).

Linux
-------
If you are a linux user, you just need to type ./build.sh and it will build the binary for you without a problem as long as freepascal is in your path (which it should be)
FreePascal Compile has only been tested with 2.0.0

Windows
-------
Delphi6+:
if you are compiling with Delphi, just use Build.bat and it will compile without a problem as long as delphi is in your path (which it should be)
Delphi Compile has only been tested with Delphi 6

FreePascal (FPC):
if you are compiling with FreePascal, use Build_FPC.bat and it will compile without a problem as long as freepascal is in your path (which it should be)
